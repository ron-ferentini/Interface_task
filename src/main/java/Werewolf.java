/* ToDo:Implement the methods speak() and sound().
* The speak() method should check the boolean value isHumanForm and if the answer is true, return "I am a human."
* If the value is false, return "I cannot speak in wolf form."
* The sound() method should check the boolean value isHumanForm and if the answer is true, return "No sound in human form."
* If the value is false, return "Howl!"
* It's important that the returned values are exactly as specified so that the tests pass successfully. */
